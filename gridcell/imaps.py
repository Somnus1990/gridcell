        :max_sigma: maximum standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel used in
                    the Gaussian-Laplace filter, given in the units used by the
                    underlying BinnedSet2D (NOT in bins/pixels, unlike

                    height of detected peaks in the arrays created by passing
                    the intensity array through a Gaussian-Laplace filter). If

        :overlap: maximum fraction of overlap of two detected blobs.
                  If any two blobs overlap by a greater fraction than this, the
                  smaller blob is discarded. Default value: 0.5.
        :log_scale: if True, intermediate sigma values are chosen with regular
                    spacing on a logarithmic scale betweeen min_sigma
                    and max_sigma. This way, the errors in estimated blob
                    centers and sizes will scale approximately with the blob
                    sizes. If False, the intermediate sigmas are chosen with
                    regular spacing on a linear scale, and the errors will be
                    approximately constant. Default is True.
        :returns: an array with a row [x, y, s] for each detected blob, where
                  x and y are the coordinates of the blob center and s is the
                  sigma (standard deviation) of the Gaussian kernel that

                  unlike skimage.feature.blob_log()). An estimate of the radius
