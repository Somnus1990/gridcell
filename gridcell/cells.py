"""File: cells.py
Module defining classes to represent multiple tetrode spike train recordings
from neurons during behavior, and facilitate the analysis of the spatial
modulation of the neuronal activity. The module is specifically geared at
analyzing spatial firing rate maps from grid cells, and the grid patterns they
define, but can be extended to analyze all kinds of cells with spatially
modulated behavior.

        Plot the mean of empirical L-function values

        The mean is based on simulated patterns using

               PointPattern instance that underlies the simulation. If None, all
               cells are included.
        :edge_correction: flag to select the handling of edges. See the
