"""File: cells.py
Module defining classes to represent multiple tetrode spike train recordings
from neurons during behavior, and facilitate the analysis of the spatial
modulation of the neuronal activity. The module is specifically geared at
analyzing spatial firing rate maps from grid cells, and the grid patterns they
define, but can be extended to analyze all kinds of cells with spatially
modulated behavior.
